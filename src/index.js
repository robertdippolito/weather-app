//CORE
//Display a 5-day weather forecast, where each day shows the high and low temperatures, and an image for
//sunny/rainy/cloudy/snowy. Use fake, hard-coded data until youâ€™ve got everything rendering correctly.
//BONUS
//Add the ability to click on a day, and see its hourly forecast. You can just maintain the current view in the top-level App state.
//Add React Router to the project (npm install react-router) and follow the quick start guide here to add routes, such that / shows the 5-day forecast, and /[name-of-day] shows the hourly forecast for a particular day.
//Sign up for a free API key from Open Weather Map, fetch a real 5-day forecast, and feed that data into your app.
//Want to get really fancy? Add a graphics library like vx and follow the examples here to add a graph of the temperature over the course of a week or day.
